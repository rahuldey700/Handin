            <h3>Redesigning a Website</h3>
            <p>I chose to redesign the Hengs Thai restaurant website. The current website had issues with contrast/readability, content discovery, and usability. Improving the website could potentially increase visitor traffic and takeout/delivery orders.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
            <img class="responsive-image" src="Assets/Hengs.png" alt="Original Heng's Thai Website">
            </div>
            <p>Links: <a href="https://www.hengpvd.com/home"> Hengs Original Website</a> </p>
            <p>Detailed reasons for choosing this website include addressing usability and accessibility problems.</p>
